# Cybersecurity Bootcamp:
For the past 24 weeks I have learned more about Cybersecurity than ever before! With topics ranging from Linux Fundamentals, Network/Cloud Security, Web Vulnerabilities, and Red vs Blue, there has been a tremendous amount of information presented. Cybersecurity is a fascinating subject and certainly not one that will be going away any time soon. As long as the world continues to use technology as they are in this fast paced environment, there will always be a need for protecting one's data and personal information.

## Final Project:
For this final project we covered a variety of different concepts. From an offensive mind we attacked a target machine. Then with a Security Engineering focus we had alerts set and ready for an attacker's presence. Finally, we also looked at live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities with illegal downloads or suspicious activity.
